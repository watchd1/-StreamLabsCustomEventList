# -StreamLabsCustomEventList
This is the code for a custom event list for stream labs for use with streaming software like OBS.

Once in StreamLabs on the events list screen, choose "Custom CSS" as your theme.
Past the code from the CustomEventList.css file into the code box below that.
From there you can use the options to choose your colors, font, font size, and screen orientation. 
Make sure max events is set to 5, I recommend about 22px -24px font size. 
The animation options won't do anything as that is hard coded.
